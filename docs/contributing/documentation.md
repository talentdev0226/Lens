# Documentation

We are glad to see you are interested in contributing to Lens documentation. If this is the first Open Source project you will contribute to, we strongly suggest reading GitHub's excellent guide: [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute).

## Finding Documentation Issues to Work On

You can find a list of open documentation related issues [here](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarea%2Fdocumentation). When you find something you would like to work on:

1. Express your interest to start working on an issue via comments.
2. One of the maintainers will assign the issue for you.
3. You can start working on the issue. Once done, simply submit a pull request.

## Requirements for Documentation Pull Requests

When you create a new pull request, we expect some requirements to be met.

* Follow this naming convention for Pull Requests:
  * When adding new documentation, add `New Documentation:` before the title. E.g. `New Documentation: Getting Started`
  * When fixing documentation, add `Fix Documentation:` before the title. E.g. `Fix Documentation: Getting Started`
  * When updating documentation, add `Update Documentation:` before the title. E.g. `Update Documentation: Getting Started`
* If your Pull Request closes an issue you need to write `Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER` where the ISSUE_NUMBER is the number in the end of the link url that will link your pull request to the issue, when merged will close that issue.
* For each pull request made, we run tests to check if there are any broken links, the markdown formatting is valid and the linter is passing.
