# Wrapping Up

In the [Your First Extension](your-first-extension.md) topic, you learned how to create and run an extension. In the [Extension Anatomy](anatomy.md) topic, you learned fundamental concepts to Lens extension development. However, this is just a small glimpse of what can be created with Lens Extensions. Below are some suggested routes for furthering your Lens extension development skills.

## Extension Capabilities

In this section, we split the Lens extension points into a few categories, each with short descriptions as to what your extension could achieve. Validate that your extension idea is achievable by reading the [Extension Capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md) section for new extension ideas.

## Guides & Samples

We have a great collection of sample extensions that you can adapt from, and some of them include a detailed guide that explains the source code. You can find all Samples & Guides in the [lens-extension-samples](https://github.com/lensapp/lens-extension-samples) repository.

## Testing and Publishing

This section includes topics that help you develop high-quality Lens extensions. For example, you can learn

* How to add [integration tests](../testing-and-publishing/testing.md) for your extension
* How to [publish your extension](../testing-and-publishing/publishing.md)
