# Lens Extension API

The Extensions API in Lens allows users to customize and enhance the Lens experience by creating their own menus or page content that is extended from the existing pages. Many of the core features of Lens are built as extensions and use the same Extension API.

This documentation describes:

* How to build, run, test and publish an extension
* How to take advantage of Lens's Extension API
* Where to find [guides](guides/overview.md) and [code samples](https://github.com/lensapp/lens-extension-samples) to help get you started

Code samples are available at [lensapp/lens-extension-samples](https://github.com/lensapp/lens-extension-samples).

## What can extensions do

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with the Extension API:

## How to build extensions

Building a good extension can take a lot of effort. Here is what each section of the API doc can help you with:

* **Get Started** teaches fundamental concepts for building extensions with the Hello World sample.
* **Extension Capabilities** dissects Lens's Extension API into smaller categories and points you to more detailed topics.
* **Extension Guides** includes guides and code samples that explain specific usages of Lens Extension API.
* **Testing and Publishing** includes in-depth guides on various extension development topics, such as testing and publishing extensions.
* **Advanced Topics** explains advanced concepts such as integrating with 3rd party applications/services.
* **References** contains exhaustive references for the Lens Extension API, Contribution Points, and many other topics.

## What's new

Lens updates on a monthly cadence, and that applies to the Extension API as well. New features and APIs become available every month to increase the power and scope of Lens extensions.

To stay current with the Extension API and Lens features in general, you can review the [release notes](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/releases).

## Looking for help
