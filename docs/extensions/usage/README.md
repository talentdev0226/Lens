# Using Extensions

The features that Lens includes out-of-the-box are just the start.
Lens extensions let you add new features to your installation to support your workflow.
Rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the Lens UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by Lens itself.
