# Removing clusters

You can remove Lens clusters using the context menu that appears when you hover over the cluster in the left-side menu that you want to remove. By right-clicking the cluster of choice you can hit the `Remove` button to delete it from your list. 

To remove a cluster from your cluster list:

1. Hover over the name of the cluster you want to remove in the left side menu. A context menu will appear.
2. Click **Remove**.

**NOTE**: This will only remove the cluster from your Lens cluster list. It will not affect your actual Kubernetes cluster or its configuration.
