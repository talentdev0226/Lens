Lens is the only IDE youâ€™ll ever need to take control of your Kubernetes clusters. It is a standalone application for MacOS, Windows and Linux operating systems. It is open source and free.

## What makes Lens special?

* Amazing usability and end-user experience
* Multi cluster management: support for hundreds of clusters
* Standalone application: no need to install anything in-cluster
* Real-time cluster state visualization
* Resource utilization charts and trends with history powered by built-in Prometheus
* Terminal access to nodes and containers
* Performance optimized to handle massive clusters (tested with a cluster running 25k pods)
* Full support for Kubernetes RBAC

## Installation

Download a pre-built package from the [releases](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/releases) page. Lens can be also installed via [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/kontena-lens) (Linux only).

Alternatively on Mac:
```
brew cask install lens
```

## Development

> Prerequisites: Nodejs v12, make, yarn

* `make init` - initial compilation, installing deps, etc.
* `make dev` - builds and starts the app
* `make test` - run tests

## Development (advanced)

Allows for faster separate re-runs of some of the more involved processes:

1. `yarn dev:main` compiles electron's main process part and start watching files 
1. `yarn dev:renderer` compiles electron's renderer part and start watching files  
1. `yarn dev-run` runs app in dev-mode and restarts when electron's main process file has changed

## Developer's ~~RTFM~~ recommended list:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) (front-end/back-end) 
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (front-end, ui)
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) (app-state-management, back-end/front-end)
- [ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org/docs) (chrome/node)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/) (api docs)
