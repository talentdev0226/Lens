Lens is the only IDE youâ€™ll ever need to take control of your Kubernetes clusters. It is a standalone application for MacOS, Windows and Linux operating systems. It is open source and free.

## What makes Lens special?

* Amazing usability and end user experience
* Multi cluster management; Support for hundreds of clusters
* Standalone application; No need to install anything in-cluster
* Real-time cluster state visualization
* Resource utilization charts and trends with history powered by built-in Prometheus
* Terminal access to nodes and containers
* Performance optimized to handle massive clusters (tested with a cluster running 25k pods)
* Full support for Kubernetes RBAC

## Installation

Download a pre-built package from the [releases](https://github.com/lensapp/lens/releases) page. Lens can be also installed via [snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/kontena-lens) (Linux only).

## Development

> Prerequisites: Nodejs v12, make, yarn

* `make init` - initial compilation, installing deps, etc.
* `make dev` - builds and starts the app
* `make test` - run tests

## Development (advanced)

Allows faster separately re-run some of involved processes:

1. `yarn dev:main` compiles electron's main process and watch files 
1. `yarn dev:renderer:vue` compiles electron's renderer vue-part  
1. `yarn dev:renderer:react` compiles electron's renderer react-part
1. `yarn dev-run` runs app in dev-mode and restarts when electron's main process file has changed

Alternatively to compile both render parts in single command use `yarn dev:renderer`
