## What makes Kontena Lens special?

Many people might compare Kontena Lens to [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) open source project since they both deliver UI to Kubernetes. But Kontena Lens is more than just an UI. It's the only management system youâ€™ll ever need to take control of your Kubernetes clusters:

* Amazing usability and end user experience
* Real-time cluster state visualization
* Resource utilization charts and trends with history powered by built-in Prometheus
* Terminal access to nodes and containers
* Fully featured role based access control management
* Dashboard access and functionality limited by RBAC
* Professional support available
